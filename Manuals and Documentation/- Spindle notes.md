- 3.7 kW spindle servo at 12k? RPM
    - Incremental magnetic encoder
        - What resolution?
    - 
- Honwin H150-2S3.7GB-MC-ABZ driver
    - Has RS485 Modbus interface
    - Might take HW-EtherCAT expansion card to enable EtherCAT communication
        - I'd REALLY like this to be possible
        - Looks like the incremental encoder card uses the expansion slot that the HW-EtherCAT card would go into

        - I think this uses classicladder, but not entirely sure

- Example with a different VFD: https://forum.linuxcnc.org/24-hal-components/37715-mb2hal-vacon-vfd
