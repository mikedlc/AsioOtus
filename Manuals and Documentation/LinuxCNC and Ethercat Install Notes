Install base LinuxCNC Image from USB Drive

sudo apt update
sudo apt install  linuxcnc-ethercat

Reports missing .deb files due to legacy version names. Note errored missing files and go download them.

Per https://forum.linuxcnc.org/ethercat/53785-installing-ethercat-repositories?start=0

cd Downloads/ where you downloaded the .deb files.
Run this command for all downloaded files:
sudo dpkg -i ethercat-dkms_1.6.1.g419f621-1+8.3_all.deb

The first one will complain about dependencies. Install the first dependency, libtool, which will fail. Repair it:

sudo apt-get install libtool
sudo apt --fix-broken install

Run dpkg to install the downloaded .deb files.

Set up networking:

obtain your mac address:
ip a

Save the MAC address of the NIC to be used for ethercat.
Update the ethercat config file to use that MAC address:

sudo geany /etc/ethercat.conf

Set your Master0 device to your MAC address and device modules to generic. Make these edits:
(Note at this stage only the generic driver is available under the Bookworm kernel)

MASTER0_DEVICE="xx:aa:yy:zz:bb:cc"
DEVICE_MODULES="generic"

save and close geany

Note, we have found in some circumstances ethercat master wants to use the first NIC listed in ip a if multiple NIC's are installed
If you experience problems after installation is complere, swap your network cables around and edit the MAC address in ethercat.conf


Enter these commands to start the ethercat service:
sudo systemctl enable ethercat.service
sudo systemctl start ethercat.service
sudo systemctl status ethercat.service
sudo chmod 666 /dev/EtherCAT0

Ethercat should be running. If the above command is not found, you have a problem.
You can list the slaves if you type:
ethercat slaves

To ensure the ethercat port has permissions on startup. Create a udev rule.
(Without this, on a restart, you always needed to chmod the ethercat port.)

sudo geany /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ethercat.rules
Add the following:
KERNEL=="EtherCAT[0-9]", MODE="0777"
Save and exit, then type:
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

reboot your computer.

LinuxCNC is now installed with the Ethercat service running. You must now install cia402 drivers.

Install Git:
sudo apt-get install git

Install dev packages, which are helpful for many modules going forward:
sudo apt install mercurial build-essential automake tree dkms bison flex


Install the cia402 drivers:

cd ~/dev
git clone https://github.com/dbraun1981/hal-cia402
cd hal-cia402
sudo halcompile --install cia402.comp

halcmd loadusr -W lcec_conf ethercat-conf.xml
halcmd show pin lcec

You should see this and hopefully a few other pins displayed

Component Pins:
Owner   Type  Dir         Value  Name
     4  u32   OUT    0x00000001  lcec.conf.master-count
     4  u32   OUT    0x00000004  lcec.conf.slave-count


If you'd like, run a latency test to get a baseline performance reading:
su [username] -c "latency-histogram --nobase --sbinsize 1000 --nox 2>&1 | tee 1598475314.lat &"

You probably need to configure the servo driver Digital Inputs and/or Outputs to stop them from erroring out of the box. See 'Driver Manual Notes.md'.

Now go through and configure your .ini, .hal, and .xml config files.
Basic Delta config files which should work out of the box:
