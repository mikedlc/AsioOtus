<h3>Servo Wiring</h3>

- B3 servo drivers connected in series, upper port to upstream servo/computer, lower port daisy-chained downstream
	- First driver is x, then y and z
- Drivers are powered with single phase 240V via the first and third input power terminals 
	- (Use all 3 terminals w/ 3 phase power)
	- Driver power and servo power are separated so servo power can be cut with a contactor if desired
